# Kiln Asset Intake Gate

This is the H4 external-asset intake node for Hearth and Horizon. It keeps generated
GLBs useful without letting them bypass gameplay readability, scale, snapping, performance,
or source-control hygiene.

`docs/kiln-asset-intake.md` is the canonical wiring doc. `public/assets/kiln/HANDOFF.md`
is only a short pointer back here so the asset folder does not carry a second source of
truth.

## Current Decision

The Drop 1 promoted pack is accepted as curated source material:

- `public/assets/kiln/ASSET_MANIFEST.json` is the authoritative manifest.
- `public/assets/kiln/models/` contains 61 committed GLBs, 5.12 MiB total.
- The manifest has 64 records: 61 `ready`, 3 `unused`, 0 `missing`.
- The 3 unused records are `cave-mouth-arch`, `cave-mouth-dry`, and
  `cave-mouth-sea`. Do not wire them; real carved cave voids read better than a small arch
  prop inside a larger terrain opening.
- Raw generated drops remain quarantine/provenance material under
  `public/assets/kiln/generated/` when present. They must stay ignored and out of commits.

Run:

```bash
npm run proof:kiln-assets
```

Current proof result, 2026-07-07:

- 61 curated assets accepted into the committed pack.
- 18 runtime pilot candidates.
- 43 runtime-deferred assets.
- 3 runtime-rejected assets.
- 19 warnings, 0 failures.
- The proof also checks GLB headers/lengths, manifest/file parity, palette ids, animation
  metadata, secret/presigned URL leakage, and tracked raw-drop hygiene.

## Source Of Truth

`scripts/proof-kiln-asset-pack.mjs` is the authoritative gate. It validates the promoted
manifest and model files by default, then records any local generated quarantine as
provenance if present.

`tools/kiln/scripts/build-manifest.mjs` is a provenance helper. It may rebuild manifest
metadata from the Kiln catalog and raw generated outputs, but it is not the runtime gate.

`tools/kiln/scripts/promote.mjs` is the promotion step. It must run only after raw
generated assets pass proof, and it now preflights every planned source GLB before cleaning
or copying into `public/assets/kiln/models/`.

Promotion order:

1. Generate or regenerate into the ignored quarantine.
2. Prove the quarantine source material.
3. Build the manifest and promote reviewed assets into `models/`.
4. Run `npm run proof:kiln-assets` against the promoted pack.
5. Wire one runtime family through a manifest-driven loader.
6. Prove desktop and phone screenshots, fallback behavior, and that no runtime requests hit
   `public/assets/kiln/generated/`.

## DAG Node

| Node | Owner | Depends On | Exit Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H4 Kiln asset intake | Main orchestrator plus asset, UX, safety, and proof reviewer lanes | A4, H3 | Promoted pack has no integrity/security failures, raw drops remain untracked, runtime candidates are risk-ranked, and each wired family has fallback plus screenshot proof |

Parallel lanes for this node:

- **Safety/tooling lane**: verify `.env.local`, presigned URLs, source kits, raw generated
  drops, dogfood outputs, and package tarballs stay out of commits.
- **Art readability lane**: rank avatar, waystone, cave-anchor, house kit, drops,
  resource nodes, shrines, trees, and creatures by whether a player can name the noun and
  likely verb at normal play distance.
- **UX/control lane**: select assets that strengthen the survival loop instead of adding
  decoration without a player-facing action.
- **Proof lane**: keep every accepted family behind unit, browser, request-path, fallback,
  and screenshot checks.

## Runtime Acceptance Criteria

No GLB becomes shipped gameplay art until it has:

- A manifest record with `status: "ready"`, `paletteId: "sphere-planet"`, a `replaces`
  owner pointer, geometry numbers, animation metadata, and raw bbox dimensions.
- Valid GLB 2.0 magic, matching declared length, no embedded live token, bearer header,
  HTTP URL, or presigned URL marker.
- A runtime asset entry declaring scale, pivot, orientation, socket/collider ownership,
  interaction overlays, repetition policy, and procedural fallback.
- A debug-off desktop and phone screenshot proof where the noun and likely verb are
  readable without labels.
- A browser request proof showing committed `models/` paths only.
- Written acceptance or regeneration for C-grade instanceability, high mesh counts,
  high triangle counts, or unclear silhouettes.

## Runtime Decisions

First wired pilot:

- `waystone`: loaded through `KilnRuntimeAssets`, attached as a decorative body shell to
  the code-authored waystone, with `waystoneBase`, `waystoneCore`, and `waystoneBand`
  hidden only after GLB success. Attuned route glyph overlays, placement, collision, route
  readback, and fallback remain procedural.
- `door-kit`, `window-frame`, and `roof-bundle`: conditionally accepted as the first
  modular house-kit skins only after runtime normalization to the code-owned C2/C3 sockets.
  The game measures each loaded GLB template, computes the decorative scale from the actual
  runtime bounding box rather than the raw manifest bbox, and fits the final visible shell
  to the `doorKit`, `windowFrame`, or `roofBundle` socket. Collision, snap, opening,
  shelter, save, relocation, and comfort-light truth remain procedural. `window-frame`
  keeps its C-grade instanceability note, but the current acceptance is explicit because it
  remaps the wide local axis to wall width and is browser-proofed in
  `npm run proof:c2-c3-building-snap-grid`.

Runtime pilot candidates from the proof:

- `chest`, `campfire`, `bedroll`, `crop-plot`, `cave-anchor`, `drying-rack`,
  `weather-vane`, `waystone`.
- Resource/drop candidates: `drop-wood-logs`, `drop-ore-chunk`.
- Resonance/resource-node candidates: `node-hearth-coal`, `node-rain-reed`,
  `node-salt-shell`, `node-lantern-shard`, `node-root-pod`, `node-red-nodule`,
  `node-bell-crystal`, `node-horizon-shard`.

Deferred until scale, snap, budget, readability, or animation proof exists:

- Remaining modular house/build pieces: `dock-segment`, `compost-bin`, and `root-cellar`.
  The house-kit warning still applies: independently generated pieces do not share wall
  heights, opening sizes, wall thickness, or grid units unless the game imposes that
  contract. The accepted door/window/roof skins prove the cheapest safe path: keep the
  procedural socket/collider/snap volume as load-bearing, measure each loaded GLB template,
  normalize it to the socket, and hide duplicated procedural body parts only after GLB
  success. Future pieces need the same fitted-bbox diagnostics, fallback proof, and
  screenshot proof before shipping as craftable art.
- Functional props with warnings or watery placement needs: `workbench`, `rain-cistern`,
  `fish-trap`, `shore-net`, `lantern-post`.
- Shrines, craters, and trees: defer for blind screenshot readability, world-placement
  scale, repetition/LOD policy, and collision proof.
- Creatures: all 9 have `hasSkin:false` and node-transform `idle`/`walk` clips. Wire later
  with `THREE.AnimationMixer` by clip name after native-life behavior/combat rules choose
  harmless, useful, and aggressive roles.

Rejected for runtime:

- `cave-mouth-arch`, `cave-mouth-dry`, `cave-mouth-sea`. Keep carved terrain entrances and
  code-authored cave-mouth dressing.

## Room For Wonder

Reserve a small lane for assets that make the planet feel authored rather than merely
efficient: strange root-vaults, storm seats, glass-rain craters, harmless odd creatures,
and shrine silhouettes that invite investigation. Wonder still goes through the same gate;
it earns room by being readable, performant, and connected to a verb.
